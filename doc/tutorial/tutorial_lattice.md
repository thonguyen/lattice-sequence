Lattice

Create your own lattice
-----------------------

### Manually

You can define your own (small) lattice by creating its nodes and edges.

Exemple : the non-modular lattice $M_5$ can be defined as follow :

1. Call the empty constructor `Lattice l = new Lattice();`
2. Add nodes :

~~~Java
Node a = new Node('a'); l.addNode(a);
Node b = new Node('b'); l.addNode(b);
Node c = new Node('c'); l.addNode(c);
Node d = new Node('d'); l.addNode(d);
Node e = new Node('e'); l.addNode(e);
~~~

3. Add edges :

~~~Java
Edge ab = new Edge(a, b); l.addEdge(ab);
Edge bc = new Edge(b, c); l.addEdge(bc);
Edge ad = new Edge(a, d); l.addEdge(ad);
Edge de = new Edge(d, e); l.addEdge(de);
Edge ec = new Edge(e, c); l.addEdge(ec);
~~~

You can now verify your lattice with two following methods :

1. A string representation on the standard output : `System.out.println(l.toString());`. This method is inherited from `DGraph`.

2. An export in .dot format file with the instruction : `l.save("M5.dot");`.

Generated `M5.dot` contains :

    digraph G {
        Graph [rankdir=BT]
        90 [label="a"]
        91 [label="b"]
        92 [label="c"]
        93 [label="d"]
        94 [label="e"]
        90->91
        90->93
        91->92
        93->94
        94->92
    }

With [graphviz tools](http://www.graphviz.org/), you can generate the following `.png` image :

### From `LatticeFactory`

LatticeFactory class provides few methods to get example lattices :

1. Call `Lattice b = LatticeFactory.booleanAlgebra(13);` to get boolean algebra with $2^{13}$ elements in variable `b`.
2. Call `Lattice p = LatticeFactory.permutationLattice(7);` to get lattice of permutation of the set $\{1,\ldots,7\}$ in variable `p`.
3. Call `Lattice r = LatticeFactory.randomLattice(19);` to get a random lattice with $19$ nodes in variable `r`.
4. Call `Lattice p = LatticeFactory.product(l, r);` to get cartesian product lattice $l \times r$ in variable `p`.
5. Call `Lattice d = LatticeFactory.doublingConvex(l, c);` to get lattice in which convex $c$ of lattice $l$ has been doubled in variable `d`.

### From wherever you want

1. From a context, you can generate a `ConceptLattice` which is of course a lattice, by calling `context.conceptLattice(true);`. See ConceptLattice tutorial for more details.
2. From an implicational system, via `BijectiveComponent`. See BijectiveComponent tutorial for more details.

Basic computations
------------------

Suppose you have your own lattice in variable l and you want to explore its properties.

As an example, we'll use lattice $M_5$ previoulsy defined.

* Top element

Let's begin with a very basic computation : the top element. 

To do, use the following code : `Node top = l.top();`. Of course, you can output its content with `System.out.println(top.toString());`.

In our example, with $M_5$, top element is $c$.

Recall that top is at the top of the representation but it is the smallest element.

* Bottom element

Continue with the dual of top element : the bottom element. 

Use the following code : `Node bot = l.bottom();`.

In our example, with $M_5$, bottom element is $a$.

* Meet of two elements

Here are main properties of lattices. A lattice is a partially ordered set (a.k.a. poset) in which least upper bound (l.u.b. or join) and greatest lower bound (g.l.b. or meet) of two elements exists.

Go on with our $M_5$ example, meet of nodes $b$ and $d$ is $a$. It can be computed with the following code : `Node m = l.meet(b, d);`.

* Join of two elements

Still with $M_5$ example, join of nodes $b$ and $d$ is $c$. It can be computed with the following code : `Node j = l.join(b, d);`.

Irreductibles computations
--------------------------

* Irreductible elements

Irreductible elements are of great importance in lattices. 

Recall a join irreductible $j$ in a lattice $l$ is a special element that can NOT be obtained as a join of others. Of course, meet irreductibility is the dual notion.

A nice caracterization of join irreductible is the following : $j$ is a join irreductible if and only if it has only one predecessor, usually noted $j^-$.

Dually, $m$ is a meet irreductible if and only if it has only one successor, usually noted $m^+$.

You can compute the set of join irreductibles of a lattice $l$ with `TreeSet<Node> joinIrr = l.joinIrreductibles();`.

Dually, you can compute the set of meet irreductibles of a lattice $l$ with `TreeSet<Node> meetIrr = l.meetIrreductibles();`.

In the previous example $M_5$, nodes $b$, $d$, $e$ are join and meet irreductibles.

* New example

Consider the all new lattice :

~~~Java
Lattice l = new Lattice();
Node b = new Node('b'); l.addNode(b);
Node c = new Node('c'); l.addNode(c);
Node d = new Node('d'); l.addNode(d);
Node e = new Node('e'); l.addNode(e);
Node f = new Node('f'); l.addNode(f);
Node g = new Node('g'); l.addNode(g);
Node t = new Node('t'); l.addNode(t);
Edge bc = new Edge(b, c); l.addEdge(bc);
Edge bd = new Edge(b, d); l.addEdge(bd);
Edge be = new Edge(b, e); l.addEdge(be);
Edge cf = new Edge(c, f); l.addEdge(cf);
Edge df = new Edge(d, f); l.addEdge(df);
Edge dg = new Edge(d, g); l.addEdge(dg);
Edge eg = new Edge(e, g); l.addEdge(eg);
Edge ft = new Edge(f, t); l.addEdge(ft);
Edge gt = new Edge(g, t); l.addEdge(gt);
~~~

Such lattice is better understood with a nice picture :

![Example Lattice](Example.png)

Here, join irreductibles are $c$, $d$ and $e$ whereas meet irreductibles are $c$, $d$, $f$ and $g$

* Irreductible generators

Given a node $n$ which is NOT a join irreductible, you can compute join irreductibles such that $n$ is join of these elements.

For example, with our new example, node $f$ is generated with two join irreductibles $c$ and $d$, computed with `TreeSet<Comparable> joingen = l.joinIrreducibles(f);`.

Dually, `TreeSet<Comparable> meetgen = l.meetIrreducibles(d);` show that node $d$ is obtained as meet of $f$ and $g$ that are meet irreductibles.

To conclude on these irreductibles, you can compute the subgraph of all irreductibles with `DAGraph dag = l.irreduciblesSubgraph();`, and get following result :

![Irreductible Graph](IrreductibleGraph.png)

And, last but not least, you can compute the context :

        Observations: c e f g 
        Attributes: c d e 
        c : c 
        e : e 
        f : c d 
        g : d e 

in which observations are meet irreductibles, attributes are join irreductibles, and an attribute is extent of an observation when its join irreducible node is greater than the meet irreducible node in the lattice.

That computation is done by `Context ctx = l.getTable();`.

Closure computations
--------------------

* `joinClosure` method

First recall that any lattice $L$ is isomorphic to the lattice obtained by replacing each node $n$ of $L$ by the node containing all join irreductible predecessors of $n$. 

Given a lattice $l$, calling `l.joinClosure();` returns this isomorphic lattice. Be careful of the fact that `joinClosure()` actually returns a `ConceptLattice`.

Using the previous example, you get :

![Join Closure](JoinClosure.png)

* `meetClosure` method

This is the dual of the previous method which is used in the same way.

From our example, `l.meetClosure();` gives :

![Meet Closure](MeetClosure.png)

* `irreductibleClosure` method

This time, we get the two previous results in one ConceptLattice.

From our example, `l.irreductibleClosure();` gives :

![Irreductible Closure](IrreductibleClosure.png)

Implicational System computations
---------------------------------

* `getImplicationalSystem` method

An implicational system of a lattice corresponds to the set of functionnal dependancies, a database notion, on join irreductibles of the lattice.

First recall our example :

![Example Lattice](Example.png)

Then take its join closure :

![Join Closure](JoinClosure.png)

Thus, the only functionnal dependancy you can get is :

    c e -> d
	
However, the `getImplicationalSystem` method returns a right maximal system. 
Then, the instruction `l.getImplicationalSystem()` returns :

    c e -> c d e

* `getDependencyGraph` method

The dependency graph is a condensed representation of a lattice that encodes its minimal generators, and its canonical direct basis.
In the dependency graph, nodes are join irreducibles, egdes correspond to the dependency relation between join-irreducibles :

$j \rightarrow j'$ if and only if there exists a node $x$ in the lattice such that $x$ is not greater than $j$ and $j'$, and $x \vee j' > j$

Edges are labeled with the smallest subsets $X$ of join-irreducibles such that the join of elements of $X$ corresponds to the node $x$ of the lattice.

The dependency graph is generated in ${\cal O}(nj^3)$ where $n$ is the number of nodes of the lattice, and $j$ is the number of join-irreducibles of the lattice.

Going on with the same lattice, we get its dependancy graph with `l.getDependencyGraph();`

![Dependency Graph](DependencyGraph.png)

* `getCanonicalDirectBasis` method

The canonical direct basis is a condensed representation of a lattice encoding by the dependency graph.

This canonical direct basis is deduced from the dependency graph of the lattice : 
for each edge $b \rightarrow a$ valuated by a subset $X$, the rule $a+X \rightarrow b$ is a rule of the canonical direct basis.

With our example, `l.getCanonicalDirectBasis();` gives :

    c d e 
    c e  -> d

* `getMinimalGenerators()` method

Minimal generators a condensed representation of a lattice encoding by the dependency graph.

Minimal generators are premises of the canonical direct basis that is deduced from the dependency graph of the lattice.

With our example, `l.getMinimalGenerators();` gives :

    [[c,e]]

Arrow computations
------------------

First recall basic definitions about arrows in a lattice :

Let $m$ and $j$ be respectively meet and join irreductibles of a lattice $l$.
Recall that $m$ has a unique successor say $m^+$ and $j$ has a unique predecessor say $j^-$, then :

* $j$ "Up Arrow" $m$ (stored has "Up") iff $j$ is not less or equal than $m$ and $j$ is less than $m^+$.
* $j$ "Down Arrow" $m$ (stored has "Down") iff $j$ is not less or equal than $m$ and $j^-$ is less than $m$.
* $j$ "Up Down Arrow" $m$ (stored has "UpDown") iff $j$ "Up" $m$ and $j$ "Down" $m$.
* $j$ "Cross" $m$ (stored has "Cross") iff $j$ is less or equal than $m$.
* $j$ "Circ" $m$ (stored has "Circ") iff neither $j$ "Up" $m$ nor $j$ "Down" $m$ nor $j$ "Cross" $m$.

Given a lattice `l`, the instruction `l.getArrowRelation();` returns a `DGraph` in which :

* Nodes are join or meet irreductibles of the lattice.
* Edges content encodes arrows as String "Up", "Down", "UpDown", "Cross", "Circ". 

Still using the same example, we get :
